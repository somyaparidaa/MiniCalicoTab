# MiniCalicoTab
MiniCalicoTab is a lightweight Java-based tabbing system built to help manage Asian Parliamentary Debate (APD) tournaments. It allows easy registration of teams and adjudicators, displays all current registrations, and generates basic team matchups (draws).

## Features
- Register teams (team name, 3 speakers, and institution)
- Register adjudicators
- View all registrations in one place
- Generate random draws for debate rounds
- Data saved in plain `.txt` files for easy access

## About APD (Asian Parliamentary Debate)
APD is a common 3-on-3 debating format used across Asia in schools and universities. Each team consists of three speakers, and matches are judged by adjudicators. Multiple rounds are played during a tournament, and organizing them requires a system to track participants and generate pairings â€” this is where MiniCalicoTab helps.

## Who Uses It?
This application is designed for **Tabs Directors** or **Admins** who manage the debate tournament. They are responsible for:
- Registering all participants
- Maintaining the data files
- Running the system during rounds

Participants (teams/adjudicators) do not use the app directly.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.
3. Run `MainMenu.java`.

> Java 8 or higher is recommended.
